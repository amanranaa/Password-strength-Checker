## About the Project  
This project provides a clean and modern UI for checking password strength. As a user types in a password, the app evaluates its length, character variety (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters) and gives immediate visual feedback: a coloured meter bar, text rating (Weak/Medium/Strong), and suggestions on how to improve it.

## Features  
- Input box with show/hide toggle for the password  
- Real-time strength assessment as the user types  
- Strength meter bar that changes colour (e.g., red → orange → green) based on strength  
- User-friendly, responsive design that works on desktop and mobile  
- Suggestions for improving password strength (e.g., “Add special characters”, “Increase length”)  

## Technologies Used  
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (with responsive layout)  
- JavaScript (ES6+)  
- (Optionally you can note any CSS framework or UI library if used)
